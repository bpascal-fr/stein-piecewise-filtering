%   GRANSO: GRadient-based Algorithm for Non-Smooth Optimization
%
%       Minimize a function, possibly subject to inequality and/or equality 
%       constraints.  GRANSO is intended to be an efficient solver for 
%       constrained nonsmooth optimization problems, without any special 
%       structure or assumptions imposed on the objective or constraint 
%       functions.  It can handle problems involving functions that are any
%       or all of the following: smooth or nonsmooth, convex or nonconvex, 
%       and locally Lipschitz or non-locally Lipschitz.  
%
%       GRANSO only requires that gradients are provided for the objective
%       and constraint functions.  Gradients should always be numerically
%       assessed with a finite difference utility to ensure that they are
%       correct.
%       
%       The inequality constraints must be formulated as 'less than or
%       equal to zero' constraints while the equality constraints must
%       be formulated as 'equal to zero' constraints.  The user is 
%       free to shift/scale these internally in order to specify how 
%       hard/soft each individual constraints are, provided that they
%       respectively remain 'less than or equal' or 'equal' to zero.
%
%       The user must have a quadprog-compatible quadratic program solver,
%       that is, a QP solver that is callable via The MathWorks quadprog 
%       interface (such as quadprog.m from MATLAB's Optimization Toolbox or 
%       MOSEK).  
%
%   NOTE: 
%       On initialization, GRANSO will throw errors if it detects invalid
%       user options or if the user-provided functions to optimize either 
%       do not evaluate or not conform to GRANSO's format.  However, once
%       optimization begins, GRANSO will catch any error that is thrown and
%       terminate normally, so that the results of optimization so far
%       computed can be returned to the user.  This way, the error may be
%       able to corrected by the user and GRANSO can be restarted from the
%       last accepted iterate before the error occurred.
%
%       After GRANSO executes, the user is expected to check all of the
%       following fields:
%           - soln.termination_code
%           - soln.quadprog_failure_rate
%           - soln.error (if it exists)
%       to determine why GRANSO halted and to ensure that GRANSO ran
%       without any issues that may have negatively affected its
%       performance, such as quadprog failing too frequently or a
%       user-provided function throwing an error or returning an invalid
%       result.
%
%   USAGE:
%   - combined_fn evaluates objective and constraints simultaneously:
%
%       % "combined" format
%       soln = GRANSO(n,combined_fn);
%       soln = GRANSO(n,combined_fn,options);
%
%   OR, ALTERNATIVELY:
%   - obj_fn evaluates the objective function while constraint functions 
%     are provided separately via ineq_fn and eq_fn
%       
%       % "separate" format
%       soln = GRANSO(n,obj_fn,ineq_fn,eq_fn);
%       soln = GRANSO(n,obj_fn,ineq_fn,eq_fn,options);
%
%   The first usage may be both more convenient and efficient if computed
%   values appear across the objective and various constraints.    
%
%   INPUT:
%       n               Number of variables to optimize.
%
%       obj_fn          Function handle of single input x, a real-valued
%                       n by 1 vector, for evaluating either:
%
%                       - The values and gradients of the objective and
%                         constraints simultaneously:
%                         [f,f_grad,ci,ci_grad,ce,ce_grad] = obj_fn(x)
%                         In this case, ci and/or ce should be returned as
%                         [] if no (in)equality constraints are given.
% 
%                       - Only the value and gradient of the objective
%                         function to be minimized:
%                         [f,g] = obj_fn(x)
%                         In this case, ineq_fn and eq_fn must be provided.
%                         If there are no (in)equality constraints,
%                         (in)eq_fn should be set as [].
%
%       ineq_fn, eq_fn  Function handles for (in)equality constraints
%                           [ci,ci_grad] = ineq_fn(x)
%                           [ce,ce_grad] = eq_fn(x)
%                       These are required when given obj_fn only evaluates
%                       the objective; they should be respectively set as
%                       [] if no (in)equality constraint is present.
%
%       NOTE: Each function handle returns the value of the function(s) 
%             evaluated at x, as a column vector, along with its 
%             corresponding gradient(s) as a matrix of column vectors.  
%             For example, if there are n variables and p inequality 
%             constraints, then ci must be supplied as a column vector in 
%             R^p while ci_grad must be given as an n by p matrix of p 
%             gradients for the p inequality constraints.
%
%       options         Optional struct of settable parameters or [].
%                       To see available parameters and their descriptions,
%                       type:

%
%   OUTPUT:
%       soln            Struct containing the computed solution(s) and
%                       additional information about the computation.
% 
%       If the problem has been pre-scaled, soln will contain:
%
%       .scalings       Struct of pre-scaling multipliers of:
%                         the objective          - soln.scalings.f
%                         inequality constraints - soln.scalings.ci
%                         equality constraints   - soln.scalings.ce
%                       These subsubfields contain real-valued vectors of 
%                       scalars in (0,1] that rescale the corresponding 
%                       function(s) and their gradients.  A multiplier that
%                       is one indicates that its corresponding function
%                       has not been pre-scaled.  The absence of a 
%                       subsubfield {f,ci,ce} indicates that none of the 
%                       functions belonging to that group were pre-scaled.
%
%       The soln struct returns the optimization results in the following
%       fields:
%
%       .final          Function values at the last accepted iterate
%
%       .best           Info for the point that most optimizes the 
%                       objective over the set of iterates encountered
%                       during optimization.  Note that this point may not
%                       be an accepted iterate.  For constrained problems,
%                       this is the point that most optimizes the objective
%                       over the set of points encountered that were deemed 
%                       feasible with respect to the violation tolerances 
%                       (opts.viol_ineq_tol and opts.viol_eq_tol).  If no 
%                       points were deemed feasible to tolerances, then
%                       this field WILL NOT BE present.
%
%       .most_feasible  Info for the best most feasible iterate.  If
%                       iterates are encountered which have zero total
%                       violation, then this holds the best iterate amongst
%                       those, i.e., the one which minimized the objective
%                       function the most.  Otherwise, this contains the 
%                       iterate which is closest to the feasible region, 
%                       that is with the smallest total violation, 
%                       regardless of the objective value.  NOTE: this 
%                       field is only present constrained problems
%
%       Note that if the problem was pre-scaled, the above fields will only
%       contain the pre-scaled values.  Furthermore, the solution to the
%       pre-scaled problem may or may not be a solution to the unscaled
%       problem.  For convenience, corresponding unscaled versions of the
%       above results are respectively provided in:
%       .final_unscaled
%       .best_unscaled
%       .most_feasible_unscaled
%
%       For .final, .best, and .most_feasible (un)scaled variants, the 
%       following subsubfields are always present:
%       .x                  the computed iterate
%       .f                  value of the objective at this x
%
%       If the problem is constrained, these subsubfields are also present:
%       .ci                 inequality constraints at x
%       .ce                 equality constraints at x
%       .tvi                total violation of inequality constraints at x
%       .tve                total violation of equality constraints at x
%       .tv                 total violation at x (vi + ve)
%       .feasible_to_tol    true if x is considered a feasible point with
%                           respect to opts.viol_ineq_tol and
%                           opts.viol_eq_tol
%       .mu                 the value of the penalty parameter when this
%                           this iterate was computed
%
%       NOTE: The above total violation measures are with respect to the
%       infinity norm, since the infinity norm is used for determining
%       whether or not a point is feasible.  Note however that GRANSO 
%       optimizes an L1 penalty function.
%
%       The soln struct also has the following subfields:
%       .H_final            Full-memory BFGS:
%                           - The BFGS inverse Hessian approximation at
%                             the final iterate
%                           Limited-memory BFGS:
%                           - A struct containing fields S,Y,rho,gamma, 
%                             representing the final LBFGS state (so that
%                             GRANSO can be warm started using this data).
%       
%       .stat_value         an approximate measure of stationarity at the 
%                           last accepted iterate.  See opts.opt_tol, 
%                           opts.ngrad, opts.evaldist, and equation (13) 
%                           and its surrounding discussion in the paper 
%                           referenced below describing the underlying 
%                           BFGS-SQP method that GRANSO implements.
%   
%       .iters              The number of iterations incurred.  Note that 
%                           if the last iteration fails to produce a step,
%                           it will not be printed.  Thus, this value may 
%                           sometimes appear to be greater by 1 compared to 
%                           the last iterate printed.
%
%       .BFGS_updates       A struct of data about the number of BFGS 
%                           updates that were requested and accepted.
%                           Numerical issues may force updates to be
%                           (rarely) skipped.
%       
%       .fn_evals           The total number of function evaluations
%                           incurred.  Evaluating the objective and
%                           constraint functions at a single point counts
%                           as one function evaluation.
%   
%       .termination_code   Numeric code indicating why GRANSO terminated:
%           0:  Approximate stationarity measurement <= opts.opt_tol and 
%               current iterate is sufficiently close to the feasible 
%               region (as determined by opts.viol_ineq_tol and 
%               opts.viol_eq_tol).
%
%           1:  Relative decrease in penalty function <= opts.rel_tol and
%               current iterate is sufficiently close to the feasible 
%               region (as determined by opts.viol_ineq_tol and 
%               opts.viol_eq_tol).
%
%           2:  Objective target value reached at an iterate
%               sufficiently close to feasible region (determined by
%               opts.fvalquit, opts.viol_ineq_tol and opts.viol_eq_tol).
%
%           3:  User requested termination via opts.halt_log_fn 
%               returning true at this iterate.
%
%           4:  Max number of iterations reached (opts.maxit).
%
%           5:  Clock/wall time limit exceeded (opts.maxclocktime).
%
%           6:  Line search bracketed a minimizer but failed to satisfy
%               Wolfe conditions at a feasible point (with respect to
%               opts.viol_ineq_tol and opts.viol_eq_tol).  For 
%               unconstrained problems, this is often an indication that a
%               stationary point has been reached.
%
%           7:  Line search bracketed a minimizer but failed to satisfy
%               Wolfe conditions at an infeasible point.
%
%           8:  Line search failed to bracket a minimizer indicating the
%               objective function may be unbounded below.  For constrained
%               problems, where the objective may only be unbounded off the
%               feasible set, consider restarting GRANSO with opts.mu0 set
%               lower than soln.mu_lowest (see its description below for 
%               more details).
%
%           9:  GRANSO failed to produce a descent direction.
%
%           10: NO LONGER IN USE (Previously, it was used to indicate if
%               any of the user-supplied functions returned inf/NaN at x0.
%               Now, GRANSO throws an error back to the user if this
%               occurs).
%
%           11: User-supplied functions threw an error which halted GRANSO.
%
%           12: A quadprog error forced the steering procedure to be 
%               aborted and GRANSO was halted (either because there were no 
%               available fallbacks or opts.halt_on_quadprog_error was set 
%               to true).  Only relevant for constrained problems.
%
%           13: An unknown error occurred, forcing GRANSO to stop.  Please 
%               report these errors to the developer.
%
%   .quadprog_failure_rate  Percent of the time quadprog threw an error or
%                           returned an invalid result.  From 0 to 100.
%
%   .error                  Only present for soln.termination equal to 11, 
%                           12, or 13.  Contains the thrown error that
%                           caused GRANSO to halt optimization.
%
%   .mu_lowest              Only present for constrained problems where
%                           the line search failed to bracket a minimizer 
%                           (soln.termination_code == 7).  This contains
%                           the lowest value of mu tried in the line search
%                           reattempts.  For more details, see the line

%   CONSOLE OUTPUT:
%       When opts.print_level is at least 1, GRANSO will print out
%       the following information for each iteration:

% 
%       Penalty Function (only applicable if the problem is constrained)

%           Eq          Total violation of the equality constraints
%       
%           Both are l-infinity measures that are used to determine
%           feasibility.
%
%       Line Search
%           SD          Search direction type:
%                           S   Steering with BFGS inverse Hessian
%                           SI  Steering with identity 
%                           QN  Standard BFGS direction

%                       Note that S and SI are only applicable for
%                       constrained problems.
%
%                       If the accepted search direction was obtained via a
%                       fallback strategy instead of the standard strategy,
%                       the search direction type will be printed in
%                       orange.  The standard search direction types for
%                       constrained and unconstrained problems respectively
%                       is S and QN.  The standard search direction can be
%                       modified via opts.min_fallback_level.  
% 
%                       The frequent use of fallbacks may indicate a
%                       deficient or broken quadprog installation (or that

%
%       Stationarity    Approximate stationarity measure

%                       encountered, its value will be printed in 
%                       orange, with ':X' appearing after it.  The X 
%                       indicates the number of requests to quadprog.  If
%                       the value could not be computed at all, it will be
%                       reported as Inf.
%
%                       The frequent use of fallbacks may indicate a
