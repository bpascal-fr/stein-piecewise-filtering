GRANSO: GRadient-based Algorithm for Non-Smooth Optimization


## Version 1.6.3 --- 2019-06-21

Description: minor bug fix

### Fixed

- Fixed bug: user-set opts.rel_tol was accidentally ignored


## Version 1.6.2 --- 2019-05-02

Description: minor bug fix

## Version 1.6.1 --- 2019-04-26

Description: minor bug fix

### Fixed

- Fixed bug when opts.prescaling_threshold was enabled on unconstrained problems


## Version 1.6 --- 2018-09-06

Description: minor fixes and improvements

### Added

- GRANSO now prints more informative summary on termination
- GRANSO can now be set to print only every kth iteration
- GRANSO now checks that all function values and gradients at x0 are
  correctly dimensioned, finite, and real valued
- GRANSO now asserts all input arguments are the right type (n a positive
  integer, options is a struct)
- better error message when obj_fn is not a function handle
- soln now contains unscaled versions for each of soln.final, soln.best,
  and soln.most_feasible when prescaling is applied

### Fixed

- constrained optimization: soln.best_to_tol is now soln.best, as it should
  be per the documentation
- newline is now printed at start, as it should have been

### Changed

- default value of .opt_tol has been changed from 1e-6 to 1e-8
- ascii printing is forced on Windows (due to MATLAB bug with extended
  ASCII chars)

### Maintenance

- renamed nameVersionCopyrightMsg.m to copyrightNotice.m
- updated URTM routines to latest versions (tablePrinter.m,
  isFiniteValued.m, optionValidator.m)

### Documentation

- changed all instances of "Matlab" to "MATLAB" (per guidelines from The
  MathWorks)
- updated URLs in APGL copyright notices to link directly to AGPL webpage
- corrected inconsistent version numbers in the main non-private routines
- fixed typo in help doc gransoOptionsAdvanced
- moved to markdown format for CHANGELOG
